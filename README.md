# Prototype government organisation register (OGP 2018-2020 commitment 11)

Prototype dataset of New Zealand government organisations. This supports the Open Government Partnership 2018-2020 action plan, commitment 11.

The dataset includes fields such as legal title, Te Reo MƒÅori name, addresses, and associated Chief Executives and Ministers. It also allows for the modeling of subsidiary organisations and change in the organisations over time due to changes in the machinery of government.

If you'd like to discuss and make suggestions on the dataset structure you can [raise an issue at a discussion](https://github.com/data-govt-nz/govt-org-register/issues).
